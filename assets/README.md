Task Objective: Create an employee portfolio of work samples observant of site accessibleness and responsive design.

Tasks performed to complete objective:
- create base file structure of deployable assets and index.html
- create HTML source code with semantic elements that follow logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- create the source code and integrate header/footer links to promote internal/external site navigation features in order to connect the user with the many media sources pertinant to the potential employee's online work presense
- create image elements and add accessible alt & title attributes that showcase completed projects worked on by the employee
- create and integrate external assets such as css resets, css source code, images and resume to support and organize the assests to support site functionality.

Satisfies all Acceptance Criteria and critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:
- sample a potential employee's previous work when portfolio is loaded
- presented with developer's name, recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- the UI scrolls to the corresponding section when potential employer clicks one of the links in the navigation and the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications when presented with the developer's first application
- deployed application loads when the images of the applications are clicked and user is taken to that deployed application
